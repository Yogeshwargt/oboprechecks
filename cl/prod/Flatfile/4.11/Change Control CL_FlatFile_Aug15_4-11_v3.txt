Risks and comments:
1. we added all OFT channels (185 including 40 Radios) those channels are available only in Los Andes city. In Santiago we will have 60 channels distributed in 4 TS. 

2. TS/TSID/SID, used in the previous 10G/Flat file in general could be associated to different channels now.

3. Column X, Replay duration. I add a channels where I choose replay duration for 180days. 

4. we are trying to configure correctly the channels with nDVR but without Replay. But I'm not totally clear about the configuration in the flatfile, so for 2 channels I added GuardTime information for those two channels: "CL_Fox_Sports_HD" and "CL_CDF_Premium_HD". I don't know which other columns I need to fill out.for nDVR.


5. We keep the previous 15 cities, but I added 2 more: Los Andes y Las Condes. Maybe we still need to rename current cities. So, I added 2 columns for additional LCN info, 2 columns for frequencies, 2 for symbol rate, and finally 2 more for modulation info.  

6. Those 2 new cities were also added in tab: Cities IDs

7. I added 1 new TSTV mark in TAB: TSTVProdRules

8. Change in one GroupTitle, in TAB: "ServGroupList", from: CL_SG_Pack1_HD to CL_SG_Pack_1_HD, all the channels behind the corresponding ServiceGroup were corrected with the new crid.

9. We added 5 new EDSProductID whith the corresponding Service Group. Latest 5 rows in tabs: "ProductList" and "ServGroupList".

10. Column BQ it's seem to be wrong in some rows, I'll check during our morning: frequencies could be wrong assigned for some channels from TS06 to TS10.

VTR internal checks and comments:
A. In the next Flatfile we must to check the tab "ProductList". Why the following products were created: 164062, 164063?


B. Some channels must to be checked in order to be sure about EPG number assigned. TFT team will do the tests and inform after we have all this in production, request me the list.

C. Check Products created in Nagra
